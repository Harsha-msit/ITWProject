            <p>Assassin's Creed Origins is an action-adventure video game developed by Ubisoft Montreal and published by Ubisoft. It is the tenth 
                major installment in the Assassin's Creed series. The game is set in Ancient Egypt near the end of the Ptolemaic period (49–44 BC) 
                and recounts the secret fictional history of real-world events. The story follows a Medjay named Bayek, and explores the origins 
                of the centuries-long conflict between the Hidden Ones—forerunners to the Brotherhood of Assassins—who fight for peace by promoting 
                liberty, and The Order of the Ancients—forerunners to the Templar Order—who desire peace through the forced imposition of order.</p>

            <h2>STORY/PLOT</h2>
            <p>The player takes on the role of a Medjay named Bayek and his wife Aya, as they work to protect the people of the Ptolemaic Kingdom 
                during a time of widespread upheaval. In 49 BC, Bayek, a Medjay charged with protecting the Siwa Oasis, is abducted along with his 
                son Khemu by a group of masked men and taken to an underground vault in the Temple of Amun. The masked men give Bayek a dormant 
                Apple of Eden and demand that he use it to open a secret vault. Khemu helps Bayek escape, but while struggling with one of the 
                masked men, Bayek inadvertently kills Khemu. One year later in 48 BC, Bayek has exiled himself to track down the five masked men to 
                take his revenge. He finds the first one, Rudjek "The Heron", and kills him. Bayek then returns to Siwa to kill the local priest 
                Medunamun, "The Ibis", who has been torturing Siwans for information to open the same vault. Bayek then heads for Alexandria, where 
                Aya, Bayek's wife, has been tracking another of the masked men. Aya reveals that she has already killed Actaeon "The Vulture" and 
                Ktesos "The Ram", leaving only one target left, "The Snake". Bayek identifies the Royal Scribe Eudoros as The Snake, but Bayek is 
                disturbed by Eudoros' last words, which imply there are more masked men. Aya directs Bayek to her friend Apollodorus the Sicilian 
                for more information. Apollodorus introduces him to Cleopatra, who confirms that the masked men form the Order of Ancients; Eudoros 
                was the one called "The Hippo" while "The Snake" is the other name of the Order. The Order ousted her from the throne and seek to 
                control all of Egypt by using Ptolemy as their puppet.</p>
            <p>Cleopatra gives Bayek four new targets: "The Scarab", "The Hyena", "The Lizard" and "The Crocodile". He tracks them down and kills 
                them while Aya convinces Pompey the Great to ally with Cleopatra. Bayek receives a letter from Aya explaining that there are more 
                members of the Order at large, including members of Ptolemy's royal guard who are the likely culprits responsible for Khemu's death. 
                Bayek begins to question his mission, believing Cleopatra is using him to kill her rivals. Pompey is killed by Lucius Septimius, 
                "The Jackal", forcing Bayek and Aya to sneak Cleopatra into the palace to meet Julius Caesar. Cleopatra impresses Caesar and 
                secures his support. Bayek kills Pothinus, "The Scorpion", but is stopped from killing Septimius by Caesar. Aya watches Ptolemy 
                get eaten by crocodiles when he tries to flee across the Nile.</p>
            <p>Cleopatra takes the throne as Pharaoh. Septimius becomes an advisor for Caesar and Cleopatra cuts ties with Bayek and Aya. This 
                causes Bayek and his supporters to realize that Cleopatra and Caesar have now allied themselves with the Order. Bayek gathers his 
                allies to form a brotherhood to counter the Order and defend the free will of the people. Bayek and Aya realize the Order showed 
                interest in the tomb of Alexander the Great, where they find a mortally wounded Apollodorus. Apollodorus warns them that Caesar's 
                lieutenant Flavius is "The Lion" and the true leader of the Order. He and Septimius had taken the Orb and a Staff from the tomb and 
                are going to Siwa to open the Vault.</p>
            <p>Bayek tracks Flavius to Cyrene, where he has used the activated Apple of Eden to hold the population in thrall. He kills Flavius, 
                avenging Khemu's death and returns to Aya. Aya recruits Marcus Junius Brutus the Younger and Gaius Cassius Longinus to their cause. 
                She heads to Rome with Brutus and Cassius to assassinate Caesar and Septimius. Bayek and Aya part ways but form the Hidden Ones, 
                the foundation of the Assassin Brotherhood when they both swear to protect the world from the shadows. In Rome, Aya confronts 
                Septimius, who wields the Staff of Eden and she kills him. She then infiltrates the Roman Senate and assassinates Caesar. Later, 
                she meets with Cleopatra and warns her to be a fair ruler or she will return to assassinate her. Afterward, Bayek and Aya (now 
                calling herself Amunet) begin recruiting and training other Hidden Ones as they build the Brotherhood in Egypt and Rome 
                respectively.</p>
            <p>In the present day, Layla Hassan, a researcher for Abstergo Industries, is tasked with finding and retrieving an artifact in Egypt. 
                However, she instead finds a tomb containing the mummies of Bayek and Aya. Hoping to find any relevant information that would 
                secure her a position in the company's Animus Project, Layla decides to relive both Bayek and Aya's memories using a modified 
                Animus without telling her superiors. When Layla fails to report in, Abstergo sends a team to kill her. Layla thwarts the attempt 
                on her life, but her friend and support officer Deanna is killed . Layla returns to the Animus but is later woken by William Miles, 
                the Assassin Mentor and the father of the deceased Desmond Miles. She accepts William's offer to work with the Assassins, but stops 
                short of actually joining them. The two depart for modern-day Alexandria. In experiencing Bayek's memories, Layla may encounter a 
                series of ancient structures built by the First Civilization. Each contains a message that alludes to Layla playing a pivotal role 
                in an upcoming apocalyptic event.</p>
