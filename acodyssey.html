        <h2>STORY/PLOT</h2>
        <p>The game starts with King Leonidas of Sparta at the battle of Thermpylae, King Leonidas leads the Spartan army against a Persian charge.
            The encounter is won, but Leonidas is informed by a captured enemy soldier that the existence of the mountain path has been revealed
            to the Persian army, which is moving to surround the Spartans by morning. Nevertheless, Leonidas resolves to hold off the Persian 
            advance.<br></p>
        <p>In the present, Layla Hassan recovers the Spear of Leonidas and together with Victoria Bibeau, extracts the DNA of two individuals from it,
            the siblings Kassandra and Alexios. With help from the Assassins, Layla picks one of the siblings (the "Misthios" - according to the book
            adaptation of Odyssey, Kassandra was the Misthios in Assassin's Creed canon) and activates the Animus to find the location of the Staff
            of Hermes.</p>
        <p>The Misthios started as a young Spartan child, raised by their parents Nikolaos and Myrrine, and inherited the Spear of Leonidas from 
            Myrrine as one of Leonidas' descendants. However, one day, both the Misthios and their siblings are thrown off a mountain due to an 
            oracle's prophecy, with the Misthios being dropped by Nikolaos himself. The Misthios survived the fall and fled to the island of Kefalonia, 
            where they grew up performing odd jobs until the Peloponnesian War begins.</p>
        <p>The Misthios is approached by a wealthy man named Elpenor, who hires them to assassinate "The Wolf of Sparta". The Misthios later 
            discovers that the Wolf is Nikolaos himself and confronts him. Nikolaos admits that he regrets what he had done, but did so for the 
            good of Sparta. The Misthios has the choice of executing or sparing Nikolaos and finds out that Nikolaos is actually their stepfather 
            and that Myrrine is in danger. The Misthios then returns to Elpenor and confronts him over the revelation. Elpenor reveals he knew 
            Nikolaos was their stepfather, and wanted him dead in order to drag out the war. He offers another job to assassinate Myrrine, but 
            the Misthios refuses and Elpenor flees. The Misthios then travels to Delphi to ask the Pythia the whereabouts of Myrrine, where they 
            encounter Herodotos, who recognizes the Spear of Leonidas the Misthios carries. Upon meeting the Pythia, the Misthios is warned about 
            the Cult of Kosmos, who seek to kill them and their families. The Misthios further investigates the Cult by assassinating Elpenor and 
            using his disguise to infiltrate a Cult meeting. They find that the Cult plans to take advantage of the war to seize control of all of 
            Greece and that their enforcer Deimos is, in fact, the Misthios' sibling, now brainwashed to follow the Cult's orders.</p>
        <p>The Misthios continues on their journey all over Greece, clearing out Cult corruption from both Sparta and Athens and befriending 
            powerful Greek figures such as Perikles and Aspasia. They are unable to stop Perikles' assassination at the hands of Deimos but are 
            able to reunite with Myrrine and find their true father, Pythagoras. Myrrine and Pythagoras explain that they conceived Alexios and 
            Kassandra to preserve Leonidas' bloodline, as he and his descendants have a special connection to Precursor artifacts, such as the 
            Spear of Leonidas. Pythagoras tasks the Misthios to recover several Precursor artifacts needed to permanently seal the hidden 
            Precursor city of Atlantis so that its knowledge cannot be misused by enemies like the Cult. Afterward, the Misthios manages to 
            avenge Perikles' death by assassinating his political rival, Kleon. Depending on the Misthios' actions, they can convince Deimos to 
            abandon the Cult and rebuild their family with Nikolaos, Myrrine, their sibling, and their new stepbrother Stentor living happily 
            together in their old family home.</p>
        <p>With war averted and the Cult virtually eliminated, the Misthios heads for the Cult's secret meeting place under the Temple of Delphi 
            to destroy the Precursor pyramid the Cult was using to influence Greek politics. Touching it, they receive visions of future conflicts 
            to come before destroying the pyramid. Aspasia then arrives and reveals that she was the original leader of the Cult but disagreed with 
            its actions as its members became more corrupt, and she thanks the Misthios for destroying the Cult. The Misthios has the option of 
            killing or sparing Aspasia, but cuts ties with her regardless. Finally, the Misthios after defeating various Olympos Projects based on 
            monsters from Greek legend (the Minotaur, cyclopes, Medusa and the Sphinx) and collects all of the artifacts needed to seal Atlantis 
            from their bodies, and activates a recording from the Precursor Aletheia who pleads with the Misthios and Layla that Precursor knowledge 
            and technology is not meant for humans and must be destroyed in order for humans to reach their true potential. Pythagoras reluctantly 
            passes the Staff of Hermes on to the Misthios, dying in the process. The Misthios then continues their adventures.</p>
        <p>In the present, Layla uses the data from the Animus to find Atlantis and activate it. As the Assassins analyze the data within, Layla 
            is shocked to find the Misthios, kept alive until modern times by the Staff of Hermes. The Misthios warns Layla that the world needs 
            a balance between order and chaos, the Assassins and Templar Order respectively, and either side prevailing over the other will result 
            in the world's doom. The Misthios also explains that Layla is the prophesied one who will bring balance to order and chaos and gives her 
            the Staff of Hermes, sacrificing their life in the process. Layla, however, states that there is so much of the Misthios' life they have 
            not seen, and re-enters the Animus.</p>
