            <h1 style=text-align:center>ASSASSIN'S CREED IV: BLACK FLAG</h1>
            <p>Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag is an action-adventure video game developed by Ubisoft Montreal and published by Ubisoft. The story 
                is set in the 18th century Caribbean during the Golden Age of Piracy, and follows notorious Welsh pirate Edward Kenway, grandfather 
                and father of Assassin's Creed III protagonist Ratonhnhaké:ton and antagonist Haytham Kenway, respectively, who stumbles upon the 
                Assassin/Templar conflict.Unlike previous games, gameplay elements focus more on the ship-based exploration of the seamless open 
                world map, while also retaining the series' third-person land-based exploration, melee combat, and stealth system.The game's 
                setting spans the West Indies with the three main cities of Havana, Nassau, and Kingston, along with numerous islands, sunken 
                ships, and forts.</p>

            <h2>STORY/PLOT</h2>
            <p>Samples that were taken from Desmond Miles' body in the moments after his death have allowed Abstergo Industries to continue 
                exploring his genetic memories using the Animus' newfound cloud computing abilities. The unnamed player character is hired by 
                Abstergo Entertainment, from their Montréal headquarters, to sift through the memories of Edward Kenway, an eighteenth-century 
                pirate, the father of Haytham Kenway and the grandfather of Ratonhnhaké:ton. Ostensibly, this is to gather material for an 
                Animus-powered interactive feature film. In reality, Abstergo—the Templars of the present time—are searching for a First 
                Civilization structure known as the Observatory, and are using Edward's memories to find it. The modern day is now in first-person 
                and you don't have a name or character. This thread of first-person or non-playable modern day continued till Assassin's Creed 
                Origins.</p>
            <p>As Edward, the player unravels a conspiracy between high-ranking Templars within the British and Spanish empires who, under the 
                guise of cleaning up piracy in the Caribbean, have used their positions to locate the Sage—later identified as Bartholomew 
                Roberts—who is the only man that can lead them to the Observatory, a First Civilization device which can monitor anyone anywhere 
                in the world when provided a blood sample, which they intend to use to spy on and blackmail world leaders. Edward becomes an 
                unwitting player in their plot when he kills a rogue Assassin, Duncan Walpole. Seeing an opportunity for profit, Edward takes 
                Walpole's place at a meeting of Templars in Havana, where he meets Woodes Rogers as well as Cuban Governor, and Templar Grandmaster, 
                Laureano Torres. His recklessness endangers the entire Assassins' Order, prompting him to pursue the Sage and the conspirators 
                from the Yucatán Peninsula to Jamaica, eventually catching Roberts on the island of Príncipe off of the African coast.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile, a band of notorious pirates—including Edward "Blackbeard" Thatch, Benjamin Hornigold, Mary Read (under the alias 
                "James Kidd") and Charles Vane, among others—dream of a pirate utopia where man is free to live beyond the reach of kings and 
                rulers. With Edward's help, they seize control of Nassau and establish a pirate republic. However, poor governance, a lack of an 
                economy and an outbreak of disease bring the pirate state perilously close to collapse, with the founders divided on the best way 
                forward. Edward attempts to resolve the dispute but is too late to stop the Templars from exploiting the situation for their own 
                ends.</p>
            <p>Eventually, Edward and Roberts uncover the location of the Observatory and retrieve the artifact powering it, but Roberts betrays 
                Edward at the last moment. After a brief stint in prison for the crimes of piracy, Edward escapes with the aid of Ah Tabai, the 
                Assassin Mentor, and elects to join their Order. Chasing down and eliminating Roberts and the Templar conspirators, Edward 
                retrieves the artifact and returns it to the Observatory, sealing it away for good. He is left facing an uncertain future with his 
                newfound convictions until he receives a letter informing him of the passing of his wife and the imminent arrival of his hitherto 
                unknown daughter, Jennifer Scott. Edward travels back to England, promising Ah Tabai that he will continue the fight against the 
                Templars back in England. Some years later, Edward, Jennifer (using her mother's surname in her memory) and Edward's young son 
                Haytham attend The Beggar's Opera at the London Royal Opera House.</p>
            <p>In the present day, the player is contacted by John, Abstergo Entertainment's information technology manager. John convinces the 
                player that their employers know more than they are telling and encourages them to investigate in more detail. He convinces the 
                player to hack several Animus terminals and security cameras and then has them deliver the information taken to Shaun Hastings and 
                Rebecca Crane, who are working undercover to infiltrate Abstergo. When the facility is locked down after the hacks are discovered, 
                John arranges for the player to access the Animus' core, at which point Juno materializes into an incorporeal form. She reveals 
                that although it was necessary to open her temple to avert disaster, the world was not ready for her, and she is unable to affect 
                it or possess the player character as her agents intended. John is unmasked as the reincarnated form of the Sage and attempts to 
                murder the player to cover up the failed attempt at resurrecting Juno, but is killed by Abstergo's security before he can do so, 
                thus implicating him as the one responsible for the hacks. As Roberts, the Sage admits to Kenway that he owes no allegiance to 
                the Assassins or the Templars and instead uses whoever he thinks represents his best chance of achieving his ends. With the Sage 
                dead, the player is contacted by the Assassins as they continue their infiltration of Abstergo, but neither side is able to 
                explain the Sage's presence or identify his followers, the Instruments of the First Will.</p>
